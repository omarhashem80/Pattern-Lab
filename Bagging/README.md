### Lab Structure
1. Start with `DecisionTree.ipynb` where you will find 12 TODOs (most of which are just questions or straightforward)
2. Afterwards go to `Ensemble.ipynb` the introduction, Boosting section which involves 2 TODOs and the Bagging section which will request you to implement `Bagging.py` and `RandomForest.py`
3. Go to implement `Bagging.py` which has 9 TODOs
4. After implementing `Bagging.py` go to `BaggingTest.py` and understand the tests then go back to `Ensemble.ipynb` and run the tests file from there.
5. Go to implement `RandomForest.py` which has 2 TODOs then go back to to `Ensemble.ipynb` and run the available test there.
6. Finish the 4 remaining TODOs in `Ensembly.ipynb` related to Bagging/Random Forests.
7. Read the last two remaining sections. These have no TODOs but are important to learn about overall for a comprehensive understanding of Ensemble learning.
8. Congratulations! You're done.
